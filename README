* README file for Rdtsc binding

This small Cabal package provides a Haskell binding to the "rdtsc"
machine instruction on modern IA-32 processors.  This instruction can
be used to read the number of cycles since processor startup and gives
very accurate timing information.

** Usage

Use

  runghc Setup.hs configure
  runghc Setup.hs build
  runghc Setup.hs install

for building and installing system-wide, or

  runghc Setup.hs configure --prefix=$HOME/haskell-modules
  runghc Setup.hs build
  runghc Setup.hs install --user

for building and installing in directory $HOME/haskell-modules.

Just import module "Rdtsc.Rdtsc" into your Haskell file and use

  ghc --make FILENAME

to compile your program.

Happy Haskell hacking,
  Martin
